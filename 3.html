  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the
       ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax,
       dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
       functions.</p>
    <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of
       the World Wide Web.[9] JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is
       an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites
       use it,[10] and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine
       to execute it.</p>

     <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
        functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based)
        programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular
        expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O,
        such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the
        host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.</p>
